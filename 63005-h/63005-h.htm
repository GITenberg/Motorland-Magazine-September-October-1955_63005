<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">Two Important Projects</span></h2>
<p>The establishment of roadside rests and the construction
of a bypass of the state parks on the Redwood Highway
are two vital and important projects for California.
Bills designed to accomplish these two worthwhile developments
were introduced and passed by both houses of the
Legislature, but they failed to receive executive approval.</p>
<p>In rejecting the bills, the Governor felt that they represented
only a part of an over-all development of a future
state parks program. As the head of this greatest of touring
and motoring states, he fully recognizes the merit of roadside
rests and the Redwood Highway bypass and indicates
that they will receive further consideration during the
budget session of the Legislature in 1956.</p>
<p>The touring business is a billion dollar industry in California.
It has become an integral and even necessary part
of our state&rsquo;s economy. Whatever money is spent to foster
and develop our tourist trade is an investment that will
inevitably bring rich returns.</p>
<p>If California wishes to maintain its lead in the touring
world, roadside rests are a &ldquo;must.&rdquo; All but five of the 48
states already have roadside rest programs. These carefully-picked,
off-highway spots are places where motorists
may make stops in safety. They also encourage motorists
to keep highways clean by providing free facilities for
eating lunches and disposing of litter.</p>
<p>Building a bypass highway around the redwood groves
in Humboldt County is imperative. If a four-lane highway
were plowed through them, along the path of the present
route, there would be a shameful destruction of these beautiful
and awe-inspiring marvels of the botanic kingdom.
Some groves would be virtually eliminated. However, a
bypass development to preserve these great trees can&rsquo;t be
put off much longer. The present route carries an increasing
burden of traffic and the need for an improved highway
grows more urgent each day.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly these two important measures will receive
favorable action during the Legislature&rsquo;s budget session
next year. In fact, California can&rsquo;t afford to let them be
delayed too long.</p>

<br /><i><span class="smaller">Land of California&rsquo;s Beginnings Offers Many a Charm for the Visitor</span></i></h2>
<p>In few places do History and Tradition, Romance and
the Wonders of Nature combine to offer so much to the
visitor as in the region surrounding the Bay of Monterey.</p>
<p>In the north is Santa Cruz, with its famous beach and
lovely gardens, and backed by the Santa Cruz Mountains
with their redwoods. Southward are historic old Monterey
and Carmel, the art colony which has now become a
Mecca for sight-seers and vacationists. South, again, extends
a road between the mountains and the sea which is
one of California&rsquo;s scenic marvels.</p>
<p>And as if all this were not enough, Nature has endowed
the inland valleys with such soil and climate that agriculture
flourishes on a tremendous scale.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p02.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="500" height="168" />
</div>
<p>Santa Cruz grew from the mission of the same name,
founded in 1791, and the settlement of Branciforte, established
six years later. It might have been any other community
in pastoral California until the Gold Rush, but
then the newcomers demanded vegetables, which the Santa
Cruz area was able to supply, and lumber, for which the
redwood forests in the nearby mountains were raided.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>Even in the seventies, however, this was known as a
resort region, where the nabobs from San Francisco came
to take their ease and recuperate from the strains of their
latest coups of high finance. It came into full stature with
the building of its first beach casino in 1906. Though this
promptly burned, it was as promptly replaced with the
ornate structure the public sees today. This has been
further improved and renovated in recent times, as has
also the Coconut Grove dancing pavilion which is an
outstanding beach feature. Beside the mile-long beach of
white sand with its beautifully clear water there is an
indoor salt-water plunge and a boardwalk which runs eastward
to the San Lorenzo River. These, with a varied
assortment of rides and concessions, drew 2,000,000 visitors
last year and bid fair to excel that figure by a fifth
this season.</p>
<p>The city has other claims to fame in that it is the scene
of the annual Miss California contest and the terminus of
a yearly yacht race from San Francisco.</p>
<p>In the Santa Cruz Art League Galleries is a life-size
waxwork, &ldquo;The Last Supper,&rdquo; modeled on DaVinci&rsquo;s
famous painting of the same name. In four years it has
been visited by more than 260,000 persons.</p>

<p>In the nearby mountains are the permanent convention

<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
a building capable of seating 5,000 persons. These and
other conventions rank virtually as an industry in Santa
Cruz&rsquo; economy. But Santa Cruz is more than a resort or
convention city. It is a city of flowers. The Spanish Garden
at its city hall is beautiful. The drive north along the
ocean front takes the visitor past bluffs which are ablaze
with colorful succulents and flowers. In season, whole hillsides
south of the city flame with yellow bush lupine.
Some of these plants have trunks as thick through as a
man&rsquo;s leg.</p>

<p>Bulbs, cut flowers and nursery stock are the biggest

strawberries is raised and the loganberry was developed
in a Santa Cruz garden by James H. Logan, banker,
attorney and superior judge, who crossed the wild blackberry
with the Lawton berry to produce the delectable
result. Brussels sprouts are another outstanding crop.</p>
<p>Santa Cruz also raises mushrooms, in old caves once
used for aging wine and in newer concrete structures.</p>
<p>The largest bulb farms are at Capitola, shipping 3,500,000
tulip, lily, dahlia and begonia bulbs a year. As each
of these in turn comes into bloom these farms offer a sight
to be seen nowhere else. Championing the region&rsquo;s claim

The park comprises nearly 20,000 acres, but the &ldquo;Big
Trees&rdquo; are a compact group, which may be seen in an
easy walk of about a mile.</p>
<p>Farther north is Big Basin Redwoods Park, the oldest

<p>Highly scenic routes from the north to the Monterey
Bay region are, first, the Skyline Drive from San Francisco,
then down to the San Lorenzo Valley and on
through its fine redwoods to Santa Cruz, and, second, the
beautiful highway which follows the shoreline from San
Francisco south. The main route over the mountains from
Los Gatos to Santa Cruz is spectacular. The highway from
Santa Cruz to Watsonville is a concrete ribbon between
lovely rolling hills gay with color. On the Hecker Pass
route from the Santa Clara Valley to Watsonville you can
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
see redwoods, the whole coast of Monterey Bay, and four
charming little lakes. The Chittenden Pass route, used by
railroad and highway, traverses a gorge of real scenic
interest.</p>

</div>
<p>Santa Cruz has its face to the future. Monterey, at the
other end of Monterey Bay, never forgets that it was the
place where history began for this region.</p>
<p>It was in what is now the city of Monterey that Portola,
first governor of California, and Father Junipero Serra
landed in 1770. Under an oak tree near the shore the good
father held a service and founded a mission. A stone cross
today marks the spot, though the mission was soon removed
to its present site at the mouth of the Carmel Valley
to be away from the presidio, or military post, which
Portola set up. At this mission Father Serra made his
headquarters and from it he supervised the building of
the mission chain.</p>
<p>Under Spanish rule, presidio and mission were almost
all the settlement but after Mexico had gained independence,
adobe homes grew up in the hills, stores were built
along the crooked streets and the Mexican government,
less averse to foreign trade than the Spaniards, built a
customs house. This still stands and, restored, houses a
museum. It is one of five State Historical Monuments in
the region, the others being the Serra landing place
already mentioned: the Casa del Oro, which housed a
store: the house where Robert Louis Stevenson lived for
a few months late in 1879, and California&rsquo;s First Theater,
originally a sailors&rsquo; boarding house.</p>
<p>There are also standing more than a score of other
structures erected in this Mexican era, including one built
in 1835 by Thomas Oliver Larkin, first United States
consul at Monterey, and Colton Hall, meeting place of the
Constitutional Convention in 1849. This, like almost all
the other remaining buildings, has been restored.</p>
<p>Monterey has laid out a scenic route leading directly
to or near all of these historic structures, and also including
several historic sites. Visitors may traverse this route
merely by following an orange line painted on the street
paving. At many points on it, special parking is reserved
for them.</p>
<p>Whichever way you turn, there is something to be seen
in this region. Just across from the Customs House is
Fisherman&rsquo;s Wharf, where the restaurants would feel
unhappy if they had to serve you today fish that was
caught as long ago as yesterday. Alongside it, the fishing
fleet, decked in all the colors of the rainbow, rides at
anchor. Farther along the beautiful ocean drive is the
Hopkins Marine Institute, operated by Stanford University,
and beyond that is Pacific Grove, with its beautiful
marine park and beach at Lover&rsquo;s Point and its famous
Butterfly Trees.</p>
<p>Each October, thousands of Monarch butterflies migrate
from Canada and Alaska to cluster on these pine trees in
a small reservation known as Butterfly Park.</p>
<p>How the butterflies know which trees are &ldquo;home&rdquo; no
one can explain, for they are hatched and pass through
their chrysalis stage in the North. Indeed, in recent years
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
it appears they have become confused: the number now
visiting the original trees is greatly reduced and many of
them are frequenting other pines several blocks away.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig13">
<img src="images/p05c.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="435" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Home ports for several hundred fishing vessels are Monterey, Santa Cruz and Moss Landing. This is part of the fleet which bases at Monterey.</i></p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Party boats on which the land-lubber may embark for a day of

</div>
<p>Also not to be overlooked in Pacific Grove is an excellent
Museum of Natural History. Its collection of
Monterey County birds and its displays of marine life
found in nearby waters are exceptionally complete. In
Butterfly Park is another museum, though it is called a
gallery, in which are displayed hundreds upon hundreds
of butterflies, moths and other insects.</p>
<p>If, like most visitors to Monterey, you continue to
follow the bay shore, where miles of wildflowers adorn the
bluffs, you will come eventually to the Seventeen Mile
Drive, which runs through a tremendous private preserve.
On this, for most of the way, you travel with the fantastically
blue ocean on one hand and truly marvelous dark
green forest on the other. At times your route runs on
low bluffs near the ocean, and again you are on rocky
cliffs high above. Back among the trees, near the Pebble
Beach area where the sports car races are held every year,
you frequently see homes that are almost palaces.</p>
<p>On your way you pass Cypress Point, which is one of
only two places in the world where the Monterey cypress
is indigenous, and Midway Point, a rugged rocky spine
jutting into the sea and bearing a single lone and twisted
cypress, probably the most photographed tree in the
world. Not far away is the Ghost Tree, another cypress
whose whitened trunk and limbs seem like the bones and
shroud of a fleeing wraith. Then your route leads past
Del Monte Lodge, with its array of fashionable shops, and
on through Pebble Beach, and thence to Carmel.</p>
<p>Carmel is unique, a &ldquo;village&rdquo; conceived by artists and
now perhaps the home of more well known writers,
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
painters and other workers in the arts than any other
community in the state. Carmel has no street numbers,
no mail delivery, and you have to get permission from
the town council before you may even cut down a tree
on your own property.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig15">
<img src="images/p06.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="538" />
<p class="pcap"><i>In spring the apple blossoms whiten thousands of trees and spread their delicate fragrance over many a mile in the Watsonville area.</i></p>
</div>
<p>In Carmel the trucks in which garbage is collected are
adorned with baskets of flowers. The street signs bear
carved and painted decorations&mdash;a pine cone, a squirrel,
a ship under full sail, or something else associated with the
region. The shops are small but legion, many of them
hidden away in courts and arcades which the non-resident
is likely to pass unwittingly. Their stocks are fabulous&mdash;and
not all of it expensive, either.</p>
<p>In between are quaint places to lodge, to lunch, to dine
or take tea after the English manner. Of course there
are conventional establishments, too, but somehow everything
in Carmel seems to have just a little different flavor.</p>
<p>The town stands on an oak-and-pine-clad slope with a
magnificent beach fronting on Carmel Bay at its foot.
Along the shore is a lovely drive, on which are homes
beyond the dreams of most folk. Back among the trees
are others. The comfortable domiciles built by the original
artist colony still exist, but they are a minority;
Carmel has become a place to which the wealthy, as well
as the well-to-do and the merely comfortable, come to
spend their later years.</p>
<p>Carmel has an outdoor theater, a Bach Festival and an
art gallery maintained by an artists&rsquo; co-operative. Its
Church of the Wayfarer has a garden containing, it is
said, every tree, shrub, herb and flower mentioned in the
Bible. Other gardens, formal and informal, are everywhere.
Once a year a number of the finest are thrown
open for public inspection.</p>
<p>And then there is the Mission San Carlos de Borromeo,
where Father Serra held sway. The present church is not
the one he knew; it was not begun until nine years after
his death in 1784. But under its sanctuary floor he,
Padre Crespi, Padre Lasuen and another lie buried. The
structure has many features distinctive from the usual
mission architecture, among them its massive south tower,
with outside staircase and Saracenic dome, and a star
window. It is of sandstone and has a vaulted roof as it
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
did originally but in restoration the roof angle was made
less sharp. Some of the original decoration may be seen in
a small chapel to the left of the entrance. In a side chapel
is a magnificent sarcophagus in marble and bronze, the
work of Jo Mora.</p>
<p>A few miles south of the old mission is one of Nature&rsquo;s
wonderlands&mdash;Point Lobos Reserve State Park. Here
stands the second native grove of Monterey Cypress, and
here the ocean batters ceaselessly against spectacular rocky
points which rise precipitously to make fjord-like coves.
In these deep, sharp, inlets the blue water boils into
furious bursts of white foam and spray, forming always-changing
pictures of incomparable beauty.</p>

<p>Offshore is a group of rocks haunted by both California
and Steller sea lions, an island much used by seafowl and
naturally named &ldquo;Bird Island,&rdquo; and a roiling, turbulent
channel appropriately called &ldquo;The Devil&rsquo;s Cauldron&rdquo;
which is a favorite spot of the sea otter. These strange
creatures were long thought to have been hunted to extinction
but about 30 of them appeared in 1938 off Bixby
Creek, 12 miles south of Point Lobos, and there are now
believed to be almost 100 in the group. Some ardent
pursuers of wild life are already asserting that the otter
have now increased to such an extent that the &ldquo;crop&rdquo;
should be &ldquo;harvested&rdquo;&mdash;a policy which could easily result
in extinguishing the species.</p>
<p>A mile below Point Lobos is Carmel Highlands, an
area of rich estates and fine homes, some of them set on
the very edge of the continent. The James house, in this
area, has been called the most beautiful residence in the
United States. And the gardens hereabout are a thing to
marvel at.</p>
<p>Beyond &ldquo;the Highlands&rdquo; runs a real road of romance, a
motor highway carved from the seaward face of the
Santa Lucia mountains. Most of the distance to its junction
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
with other routes at San Luis Obispo there is nothing
between this road and the blue, blue sea but the
cliffs. Above it, on the east, tower the mountains. It is no
road for the man in a hurry, but for one who loves Nature
it is glorious.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig18">

<p class="pcap"><i>South from Carmel, in the trees or on the cliffs&mdash;sometimes almost built out over the ocean&mdash;are some of the most beautiful homes in America.</i></p>
</div>
<p>This is wildflower country. Within a 20-mile stretch
you may see, in season, wild roses, primroses, California
poppies, yellow lupine, wild mustard spreading over
fields like a froth of foamy yellow, great bushes of blue
lupine marching up rocky hillsides, almost cliffs: Queen
Anne&rsquo;s lace, succulents of many colors, and sometimes
succulents which are not in bloom but whose foliage has
turned a rich, dark red; Indian paint brush&mdash;all these
abundant, in masses easy to see and recognize as you roll
along. A naturalist could find many more.</p>
<p>The Spaniards would have come by this route if they
could, but the mountains were too rugged, there was no
path between sea and cliffs, and so they were forced
inland. That this road was ever constructed was largely
due to the efforts of Dr. John Roberts of Monterey, who
used to ride horseback on calls to remote and isolated
ranches up the canyons. It was almost 20 years in building.</p>
<p>South along this road from Point Lobos, beyond Garrapata
Creek and Rocky Creek and Bixby Creek, past the
light house at Point Sur and inland a few miles, is Pfeiffer-Big
Sur State Park, a redwood park which is the entrance
to 250,000 acres of wilderness area in the adjacent Los
Padres National Forest. These redwoods are almost the
most southerly of all: the actual southernmost ones are
on Mill Creek, some 25 miles farther along the road.</p>
<p>And so to Watsonville. Watsonville exists because in
1852 one John H. Watson decided that the location was
suitable for a town and, with another man, forthwith
laid out one. Watsonville is strictly business. Even before
Watson&rsquo;s time, the Amestis, Castros, Vallejos and other
Spanish pioneer families were busily raising grain and
potatoes here. California&rsquo;s great lettuce industry got its
start in the Watsonville region and today it is a busy
center for the raising and processing of lettuce, berries,
beans, brussels sprouts, and many, many apples.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>The traveler passing through Watsonville sees only a
rather busy main street, plaza and business section, but
only a little way to one side is an area where quick-freezing
plants, ice plants, warehouses and lettuce-chilling
works cover block after block, with switch engines busily
shifting empty cars to be loaded and loaded cars to be
made into trains and headed east.</p>
<p>Some eight miles south of Watsonville is Moss Landing,
a port for vessels of moderate draft, from which the
grain crops of the region once were shipped. Now it is
the home of a picturesque fishing fleet and the scene of
one of the largest steam-electric plants in the West. This
giant, which the public may visit by obtaining a permit,
produces 771,000 horsepower. Its eight boilers are
each as high as a ten-story building and, the better to
withstand any possible earthquake, are suspended in steel
towers more massive than many bridge piers. Operators
in the control room use television to watch the leaping
flames inside the boilers and to supervise change-overs
from natural gas to fuel oil when required. Steam pressure
is an incredible&mdash;except to engineers&mdash;1,405 pounds per
square inch in one section of the plant and 1,510 pounds
in another.</p>

<p>It is inland, however, in the great valley of the Salinas,
that agriculture really hits its stride and while production
in Watsonville&rsquo;s Pajaro Valley is tremendous, that which
centers in the Salinas area is even greater.</p>
<p>In the beginning Salinas was a center for livestock
raising. Then overtones of agriculture were added as
potatoes began to be raised thereabout. Later, sugar
beets came in and the largest beet sugar refinery in the
United States was built a few miles west of the city. Today,
lettuce is the big item&mdash;two to three crops a year, worth
more than $40,000,000.</p>
<p>Production on most of the larger ranches is on virtually
an assembly line basis. Long machines, drawn by tractors,
span 18 rows of the ripe lettuce. On a platform ride
the packers, usually eight. Ahead of the machine walk
cutters, one for each row, who cut the crisp green heads.
Behind the machines are other workers who place the
heads on a table before the packers. These packers place
the heads in cartons which pass on to a worker who
closes them, and another who staples the closure tight.
The whole work proceeds so rapidly that a special worker
is required merely to unfold cartons.</p>
<p>Trucks, each of which holds exactly half a carload,
follow the picking machine and as the pallets on each
truck are piled to the proper height with cartons of lettuce,
that truck departs for a cooling plant where, under
intense vacuum, the lettuce is cooled from the temperature
of the hot field to a point just above freezing in a
matter of only 18 to 20 minutes. Then it goes into
pre-iced refrigerator cars, with the cartons still on the
original pallets, and presently is on its way to market.</p>
<p>The old methods, by which lettuce was hauled to packing
sheds for trimming, packing and icing, are now all
but superseded and firms with tremendous investments in
ice plants are wondering what to do with them, for when
it was necessary to ice each crate of lettuce Salinas produced
more ice than New York City.</p>
<p>Besides the lettuce which has given it the name &ldquo;Salad
Bowl of the World,&rdquo; the Salinas Valley also produces
more than $6,000,000 worth of dry beans, $12,000,000
worth of carrots, $5,500,000 worth of celery and quantities
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
of truck crops every year. The sugar beet crop runs to
almost $7,000,000 a year.</p>
<p>In spite of its agricultural importance, however, Salinas
still thinks of itself in terms of the old stock-raising days.
The annual Salinas California Rodeo was started in 1911
to perpetuate the sports and traditions of the Old West.
Membership on the 50-man board which controls this four-day
event is a coveted honor. In this fast, dramatic, colorful
spectacle, competition is of world championship caliber,
prizes amount to approximately $50,000 and every
effort is made to see that the stock is capable of bringing
out the best in each competitor. &ldquo;Salinas,&rdquo; said one rodeo
rider, &ldquo;is where they separate the men from the boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet, while agriculture and stock raising overshadow
them, this region, too, has its recreation features. Paraiso
Hot Springs and Tassajara Hot Springs are well known
resorts. The padres and, before them, the Indians, made
much use of the Paraiso Springs.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig25">

<p class="pcap"><i>Mission San Carlos de Borromeo, at Carmel, is often called the most beautiful of all the missions. Its Saracenic tower is distinctive.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Like all the other sections traversed by the route of the
padres, the Salinas Valley had its missions&mdash;Mission de
Nuestra Senora de la Soledad, near the town of Soledad,
and Mission San Antonio de Padua, near Jolon. Both fell
completely into ruins but now are being restored. Only
a beginning has been made at Soledad, but San Antonio
has been largely rebuilt by the Franciscan Fathers and is
in use as a training school for young brothers. It is a
&ldquo;working&rdquo; mission&mdash;that is, not only a place for worship
but a place where industry is carried on, as it used to be
at the original mission, shoemaking, carpentry, book
binding, the making of adobe brick and tile for the
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
rebuilding of the two wings which are still to be reconstructed,
and all the maintenance work.</p>
<p>In addition to agriculture, food processing, and the
activities dependent upon the sight-seers and pleasure-seekers,
the economy of this region also derives considerable
support from industry. It digs and processes sand for
making glass and for other purposes. Salt and refractories
are manufactured. Lumbering continues on privately-owned
lands in the Santa Cruz mountains, with processing
at Santa Cruz. Near Santa Cruz is one of the largest
cement production plants in America, if not the world.</p>
<p>There are small-scale textile operations and a saddle
leather plant in Santa Cruz, which city is also intensely
proud of its new chewing gum plant. There are several
seed farms producing flower seeds&mdash;a pretty sight in
summer&mdash;and more producing field crop seed. There are
busy commercial fishing fleets.</p>
<p>Stock-raising, with King City as an important center,
brings the region more than $3,500,000 every year and
dairying almost as much again.</p>
<p>Oil was discovered near San Ardo about eight years ago
and production from this field, which has 480 active wells,
holds steady at 30,000 barrels a day.</p>

has headquarters near Jolon. At Fort Ord, a few miles
north of Monterey, 30,000 to 35,000 military personnel

Del Monte Hotel at Monterey has become a postgraduate
school for naval engineering officers, with a

of Monterey, established so long ago by Portola, is
now an army school where some 400 specialists instruct
about 2,000 students in one or another of 26 languages.</p>
<p>Of late years the construction industry has been very
important, for cities all through Monterey and Santa
Cruz Counties are growing so rapidly they are fairly
bursting at the seams. At Salinas, residential development
has extended far north of the Rodeo Grounds, which
once were out in the country. Outside the city limits to the
east is another development, called Alisal, almost equal
in size to the residential area of Salinas itself. And there
are several smaller subdivisions. At Monterey new subdivisions
and communities, some very beautiful, extend
far to the north and many fine old trees are being taken
from properties along the Carmel Road to make room for
more homes. Carmel has overflowed into Carmel Valley.
Santa Cruz is adding residential construction at a rate of
about $3,000,000 annually. Watsonville has grown more
than 20 per cent since 1950.</p>
<p>Busy as it may be, however, it is all a friendly, hospitable

<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">Personal Accident Insurance</span></h2>
<p>You may go through life without
being in a traffic accident, or you may
be involved in a traffic mishap and
escape injury. But the statistics are
not in your favor. You may be unfortunate
enough to become a &ldquo;statistic&rdquo;
in police or hospital records.</p>
<p>In these days of heavy traffic, even
the most careful driver may be involved
in an accident; and police and
hospital records show that traffic
crashes today result in more serious
personal injuries than ever before.</p>
<p>That is why the California State
Automobile Association has added
extra value to CSAA membership,
and is now issuing a Certificate of
Personal Accident Insurance providing
greater protection to members
than heretofore. As in the past, this
Personal Accident Insurance is included
in your membership without
extra charge. Beginning July 1 last
year, the new certificates were issued
to members as they renewed their
memberships, and to new members as
they were enrolled.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig29">
<img src="images/p10.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="234" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Continuous membership of three years or more maintains the maximum
benefits provided by new Personal Accident Insurance.</i></p>
</div>
<p>This new Personal Accident coverage
increases in value over the first
three years of membership on condition
that membership is continuous.
The increased benefits remain in
effect contingent on continued prompt
renewal of membership over the years.
For members with three or more years
of consecutive membership, maximum
coverage became effective for the current
membership year upon issuance
of the new insurance certificate.</p>
<p>The schedule of benefits in this
added feature of continuous CSAA
membership follows:</p>
<p>Payment to your beneficiary for
accidental death involving an automobile
is based on consecutive years
of membership; first year, $500; second
year, $1,000; third year and
thereafter, $1,500.</p>
<p>Direct payments to you for other
specific losses are also increased
under this <i>accumulative</i> coverage.</p>
<p>Hospital benefits&mdash;$35 a week for
a maximum of twelve consecutive
weeks&mdash;are retained and all indemnities
are subject to the standard provisions
and limitations as specified in
the Personal Accident Certificate.</p>
<p>Your membership must be continuous
to make this new schedule of increased
benefits effective for you;
and your membership must be retained
on a continuous basis to keep
the increased benefits in effect. If
membership is allowed to lapse, the
benefits under the policy revert to the
first year basis if membership is re-instated
at a later date.</p>
<p>This accumulative plan of Personal
Accident Insurance based on continuous
membership was adopted by the
Board of Directors, not only to provide
more adequate protection, but
also to accord recognition to continuous
membership support.</p>

<blockquote>
<h3 id="c7"><i>IT&rsquo;S THE LAW
<br />Making Turns Properly On Red Traffic Light</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p10d.jpg" alt="IT&rsquo;S THE LAW" width="500" height="241" />
</div>
<p>Right turns permitted against a red light must always be made after stopping
and under certain conditions. It is timely to review these legal provisions in
view of the new California law, effective September 7, governing the procedure
of making left turns on a red light from a one-way street into another one-way
street.</p>
<p>To make a right turn on a red light, the driver should come to a halt at
the intersection as close as practicable to the right-hand curb. yielding the right
of way to pedestrians and other traffic proceeding as directed by the stop-and-go
signal. As soon as the way is clear, then the right turn may be made.</p>
<p>However, the law permits local authorities to prohibit such right turns on
a red light in central business districts. Also, local officials may prohibit right
turns on a red light outside the downtown area at any intersection under their
jurisdiction if a sign is erected at the corner notifying the motorist to that effect.</p>
<p>On making a left turn against a red light from a one-way street into another
one-way street, the driver should come to a halt at the intersection as close as
practicable to the left-hand curb. When certain there will be no conflict with
foot or vehicle traffic, the driver may proceed to make the turn.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Important new motor vehicle laws
were passed by the 1955 California
Legislature. Equally important
changes and clarifications were made
in many old laws.</p>
<p>Knowledge of these new regulations
and revisions of the Vehicle Code is
naturally vital to you as a motor vehicle
owner and operator.</p>
<p>Several centuries ago a wise thinker,
Thomas More, wrote:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>All laws are promulgated for this
end: that every man may know his
duty, and therefore the plainest and
most obvious sense of the words is
that which must be put on them.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>That advice is heeded in this article
interpreting for you the new regulations
and code revisions. The interpretations
are actually summaries stated
in everyday, non-legal language to
make for easy reading and quick
understanding of the essential elements.</p>
<p>September 7 is the effective date of
these new laws, except for a few urgency
measures which were put into
effect immediately upon approval by
the Governor.</p>
<p class="tb">The present California highway user
tax rates will remain in effect until
December 31, 1959, thus assuring the
continuation of the state&rsquo;s accelerated
highway modernization program
adopted in 1953. This new law carried
an urgency clause and became effective
January 22.</p>
<p class="tb">It is now provided in the Vehicle
Code as well as in the Health and
Safety Code that it is unlawful to dispose
of any garbage, refuse or litter
upon any highway or its right of way.</p>
<p class="tb">Driving under the influence of
liquor is a misdemeanor. The penalty
for a first conviction of such a misdemeanor
shall be automatically increased
to that of a second conviction,
if the driver already has been previously
convicted of a felony for driving
while drunk.</p>
<p class="tb">Revocation of the driving privileges
of juvenile offenders is mandatory
upon conviction of certain serious offenses.
Revocation or suspension shall
also be imposed upon recommendation
by the juvenile court judge for
convictions of less serious offenses.
The length of the terms of revocation
or suspension shall be specified.</p>
<p class="tb">Local authorities, as well as the
State Department of Public Works,
may restrict speed to 25 miles per
hour because of snow conditions.
Local authorities may also determine
the maximum speed allowable on any
bridge or structure, or in any tube or
tunnel, constitutes part of a highway.</p>
<p class="tb">The speed limit on highways where
persons are at work shall be a prima
facie limit of 25 miles per hour instead
of a fixed limit of 25 miles per
hour.</p>
<p class="tb">The speed limit for heavy trucks
and combinations is increased from
40 to 45 miles per hour.</p>
<p class="tb">The Vehicle Code provides that the
registered owner of a motor vehicle is
responsible for any parking violation
involving the vehicle. That presumption,
however, does not mean that the
registered owner is further presumed
to have violated any other provision
of the law.</p>
<p class="tb">To pass a motor vehicle going less
than 20 miles an hour on a grade, an
overtaking vehicle must go at least 10
miles an hour faster. In addition, it
must complete the passing movement
within a quarter-mile distance.</p>
<p class="tb">Heavy trucks shall use only the lane
to the immediate left of the right-hand
lane when passing another vehicle on
freeways and multiple-lane highways.
Where passing on the right is permitted,
trucks may do so.</p>
<p class="tb">A peace officer may remove an illegally
parked motor vehicle to a
garage or other place of safety.</p>
<p class="tb">U-turns are prohibited on the approaches
to or in front of any fire
station.</p>
<p class="tb">School Safety Patrol members may
be stationed at intersections near as
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
well as adjacent to a school. The actual
presence of a supervisory school
employee is not necessary at a street
crossing where a patrol is maintained.</p>
<p class="tb">Local authorities are authorized to
close certain streets for use by colleges
as well as high schools in giving
automobile driving instructions.</p>
<p class="tb">School districts, under the Education
Code, are allowed to conduct
driver training classes on Saturdays.</p>
<p class="tb">It is unlawful to refuse to obey the
directions of a fireman, whether a
police officer is present or not, when
he is protecting fire-fighting personnel
and equipment.</p>
<p class="tb">Stops at an arterial stop sign are
to be made at the limit line, if
marked, even though there may be a
crosswalk.</p>
<p class="tb">Emergency vehicles under certain
conditions are permitted to go in a
direction opposed to moving traffic
on a one-way street or roadway.</p>
<p class="tb">Authorities may erect traffic control
devices at the intersection of a highway
and a private road or driveway
if traffic conditions warrant.</p>
<p class="tb">License plates shall be mounted on
a motor vehicle not less than 12 inches
or more than 60 inches from the
ground. They are also not to be covered
with any material which decreases
or impairs their legibility.</p>
<p class="tb">Registration and vehicle license fee
reciprocity is granted to motor vehicles
registered in other states pending
the establishment of a California
Reciprocity Commission. To prevent
needless confusion and disruption in
the interstate movement of vehicles
and trade, this law carried an urgency
clause and became effective April 14.</p>
<p class="tb">The program of quarterly registration
of commercial vehicles is continued
indefinitely.</p>
<p class="tb">Additional summaries of new motor
vehicle laws and revisions of the
Vehicle Code will be published in the
next issue of Motorland.</p>

established?</i> In 1858. It ran from St.
Louis to San Francisco, the longest
stage line in the world.</p>
<p class="tb"><i>Did the United States make any
effort to acquire California prior to
the war with Mexico?</i> Yes. The
United States offered to buy this province
from Mexico in 1835.</p>
<p class="tb"><i>Where was California&rsquo;s first railroad?</i>
Between Sacramento and Folsom.
It was opened on February 22,
1856.</p>
<p class="tb"><i>What was the first American flag
ship to sail into California waters?</i>
The Otter, out of Boston, entered the
Bay of Monterey in 1796.</p>
<p class="tb"><i>Was the hydraulic method of mining
ever used outside the Mother
Lode?</i> Yes. The largest of all hydraulic
workings, the La Grange mine,
is near Weaverville, and the method
has been used in many places outside
of California.</p>
<p class="tb"><i>Who first travelled the route across
Nevada taken later by the Pony Express?</i>
This route is credited to a
party of scouts sent from Salt Lake
City in 1854 by Brigham Young. The
route was followed later by the stages
and is approximately that of the Lincoln
Highway.</p>

<p class="pcap"><b>THE BABY PULLMAN</b>, <i>recently placed on the market in infant supply stores and some
department stores, converts the back seat space of an automobile into a sleep or play
area for infants. It is a padded platform suspended from the top of the front seat by two
rubber-covered hooks and extending over the entire back seat when opened out. Two wings
fold up to make a cozy padded crib, or one wing up leaves space for an adult to sit. This
information was provided by The Herrmanns infant supply house, with stores in San
Francisco, Berkeley and San Jose, where the Baby Pullman with pad retails for $15.93.</i></p>

<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">AUTOMOBILE ANECDOTES</span></h2>
<p>The California Division of Highways,
says Assistant District Engineer
H. S. Miles, has often cautioned drivers
about horseplay while operating a
motor vehicle. Recently a report was
received by the Division on an accident
that left no doubt as to which
category it belonged. In response to
the question, &ldquo;<i>Who in your opinion
was at fault?</i>&rdquo; the driver wrote:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The horse. As I was passing a
group of horses on the roadway at a
slow speed, two of them started to
play and one backed up and sat down
on the right front fender, causing a
large dent.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">In Helena, Mont., a motorist took
a bite out of a ripe plum while driving
his car. Deciding he didn&rsquo;t like
it, he tossed it out of the car window.</p>
<p>Where do you think it landed? On
the windshield of a Highway Patrolman.
The motorist was fined for
dumping garbage on the highway.</p>
<p class="tb">Montreal police swear this story is
true. They received a telephone complaint
from a man reporting the theft
of his automobile&rsquo;s steering wheel,
dashboard, and brake, gas and clutch
pedals. Police promised an immediate
investigation.</p>
<p>A few moments later, however, the
phone rang again. The same man said
they needn&rsquo;t bother. He had got into
the back seat of his car by mistake
and thought it was the front seat.</p>
<p class="tb">In Monroe, Wis., motorists picketed
the city hall after officials decided to
raise the fine for parking violations
to one dollar.</p>
<p>It formerly was 10 cents.</p>
<p class="tb">In Toronto, a motorist hit a hole in
a road and his car careened into a
jewelry store window.</p>
<p>City authorities approved out-of-court
settlements of $2,084 to the
driver and $5,125 to the storekeeper.
The hole was fixed for $7.</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;<i>Did you get his license number?</i>&rdquo;
Oregon highway patrolmen asked a
motorist after his car was struck by
a hit-and-run driver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I sure did</i>,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;<i>I grabbed
it as he drove away.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>He handed them the license plate.</p>

<h3 id="c14">Cities Receive Awards In AAA Pedestrian Protection Contest</h3>
<p>Berkeley has won a First Place
Award in the 16th annual nationwide
Pedestrian Protection Contest conducted
by the American Automobile
Association and sponsored in northern
and central California and Nevada
by the California State Automobile
Association.</p>
<p>Berkeley received the award for its
outstanding reduction in pedestrian
deaths.</p>
<p>A Third Place Award went to San
Leandro for its reduction of pedestrian
fatalities and excellent pedestrian
protection program.</p>
<p>Honorable Mention Awards were
won by Sacramento and Richmond
for the over-all excellence of their
pedestrian protection programs.</p>
<p>Twenty cities were awarded Special
Citations for various individual
phases of their programs. They were:</p>
<p>Oakland, Alameda, Hayward,
Stockton, Modesto, Monterey, Pacific
Grove, Hanford, Tracy, Grass Valley,
Sausalito, Ross, Manteca, Sebastopol,
Fairfield, Red Bluff, Mount Shasta,
Lakeport, Sutter Creek, and Reno,
Nevada.</p>
<p>In addition to the above awards,
37 cities received Commendation Certificates
for no pedestrian deaths during
the year. They were:</p>
<p>Albany, Arcata, Belmont, Benicia,
Burlingame, Carmel, Ceres, Chico,
Concord, Daly City, Dunsmuir, Fairfax,
Fowler, Hillsborough, Livermore,
Lodi, Martinez, Menlo Park, Millbrae,
Mill Valley, Oroville, Piedmont, Pittsburg,
Roseville, Salinas, San Bruno,
Sanger, San Rafael, Santa Clara,
Susanville, Turlock, Ukiah, Vacaville,
Willows, Yreka, and Elko and Sparks,
Nevada.</p>
<p>The cities were judged in their respective
population groups on the
basis of pedestrian safety activities
and fatality and injury records.</p>
<p>The nationwide contest spurs direct
action in cities to insure greater
pedestrian safety. The results are
obvious; fatalities are declining despite
growing motor vehicle registration.
Before the contest began in
1939, as many as 15,500 pedestrians
were killed a year, compared with the
7,900 killed in 1954.</p>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small"><i>SAFE DRIVING PRACTICES</i></span></h2>
<p>Three-lane highways have a reputation as accident breeders&mdash;the middle lane
often being referred to as the no-man&rsquo;s land of the open road.</p>
<p>When using the middle lane of a three-lane highway for passing or turning
during daylight hours, a sound driving technique is to turn on your <i>headlights</i>.</p>
<p>The lights serve as a warning to oncoming motorists not only that the
middle lane is in use but also, and more important, that your car is approaching
them in the middle lane.</p>
<p>Many motorists are confused by the general appearance of modern automobiles;
and instances have actually occurred where drivers thought the other
car in the middle lane was going in the same direction they were, until it was
too late to avoid an accident.</p>
<p>There is no law requiring drivers to turn on their headlights under these
circumstances, so don&rsquo;t depend upon other drivers to have their lights on if
they are in the middle lane. If yours are on, you are not only being courteous
to other drivers, but also protecting yourself by alerting them to the fact that
the middle lane is occupied by an approaching car. Also, remember to turn
off your lights as you pull out of the middle lane.</p>
<h3 id="c16"><span class="large"><i>Curves <span class="smallest">AND</span> Crossroads</i></span></h3>

<p>Mr. Jones: &ldquo;Yes, dear. I drove off

<p>Santa, the jolly gentleman closely identified with fabulous activity during late
December, is busy at this time of year, too. He is reputed to circle the globe in a single
night at year&rsquo;s end, all the while busily popping up and down chimneys.</p>
<p>He is able to do all of this because he planned ahead. And if you want Santa to visit
you in some foreign land, start your planning now, too. Santa has to plan his trip
alone, but you can get the expert help of the Foreign and Domestic Travel Department
of the California State Automobile Association.</p>
<p>There is a special tour leaving San Diego December 17, planned so you visit Mexico
to celebrate the Nativity during Posada time. Another thrilling experience is to have
Santa visit you at sea during a shipboard Christmas party. Sail from San Francisco
on December 21 and enjoy the special hospitality of the <i>S.S. Lurline</i> on Christmas
day. Or on the South America tour leaving San Francisco on November 13, make
the optional return by sea with special entertainment provided on the <i>S.S. Del Sud</i>.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
